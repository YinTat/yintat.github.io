# CSE 599: Interplay between Convex Optimization and Geometry

In this course, we cover several frameworks for convex optimization, including, first-order methods, cutting plane methods and interior point methods. Besides covering some basic algorithms in those frameworks, we explain the geometry picture behind many of these algorithms.
