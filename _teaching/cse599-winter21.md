# CSE 599: Sketching Algorithms

Sketching algorithms are powerful techniques to compress data in a way that lets you answer various queries. In this course, we will cover various algorithms that make use of sketching techniques. This includes:
+ Randomized algorithms for linear algebra
+ Streaming algorithms
+ Compressed sensing

Prerequisites: Linear Algebra, Probabilities. Comfortable with theory courses such as CSE 521.

## Assignments
+ Nothing Now

## Class Policy
+ You may discuss assignments with others, but you must write down the solutions by yourself.
+ Assignments as well as regrade requests are to be submitted only via gradescope.
+ In general, late submissions are not accepted (the submission server closes at the deadline). Gradescope lets you overwrite previous submissions, so it is recommended to use this feature to avoid missing the submission deadline altogether.
+ We follow the standard [UW CSE policy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct) for academic integrity.
+ Please refer to university policies regarding [disability accommodations](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/current-students/accommodations/) or [religious accommodations](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/).
