# CSE 599: Sketching Algorithms

Sketching algorithms are powerful techniques to compress data in a way that lets you answer various queries. In this course, we will cover various algorithms that make use of sketching techniques. This includes:
+ Randomized algorithms for linear algebra
+ Streaming algorithms
+ Compressed sensing

Prerequisites: Linear Algebra, Probabilities. Comfortable with theory courses such as CSE 521.
