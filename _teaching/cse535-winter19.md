# CSE 535: Theory of Optimization and Continuous Algorithms

The design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor. However, many advances have come from a continuous viewpoint. In this course, we focus on the design of convex optimization and sampling algorithms. Via examples, we will explain some of the following concepts 
+ Reduction
+ Elimination
+ Conditioning
+ Geometrization
+ Expansion
+ Sparsification
+ Acceleration
+ Decomposition

We hope that these concepts will help students become a designer instead of a consumer of continuous algorithms.

This course is offered in Georgia Tech at the same time by [Santosh Vempala](https://santoshv.github.io/contalgos.html).
