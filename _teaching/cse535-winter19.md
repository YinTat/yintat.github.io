# CSE 535: Theory of Optimization and Continuous Algorithms

The design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor. However, many advances have come from a continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed (or shown) to have desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is derived from this by appropriate discretization. In interesting and general settings, the current fastest methods are a consequence of this perspective. We will discuss several examples of algorithms for high-dimensional optimization and sampling, and use them to understand the following concepts in detail.
+ Elimination
+ Reduction
+ Geometrization
+ Acceleration
+ Sparsification
+ Decomposition
