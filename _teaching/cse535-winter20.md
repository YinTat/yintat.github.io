# CSE 535: Theory of Optimization and Continuous Algorithms

The design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor. However, many advances have come from a continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed (or shown) to have desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is derived from this by appropriate discretization. In interesting and general settings, the current fastest methods are a consequence of this perspective. We will discuss several examples of algorithms for high-dimensional optimization, and use them to understand the following concepts in detail.
+ Elimination
+ Reduction
+ Geometrization
+ Sparsification
+ Acceleration
+ Decomposition

This course is offered in Georgia Tech at the same time by [Santosh Vempala](https://santoshv.github.io/2020CS6550/contalgos.html).

+ Course evaluation: 4 assignments (100%)
+ Prerequisite: basic knowledge of algorithms, probability, linear algebra.

## Assignments

The assignments are postsed in [Piazza](https://piazza.com/washington/winter2020/cse535).
Submitted via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/35189).

## Class Policy
+ You may discuss assignments with others, but you must write down the solutions by yourself.
+ Assignments as well as regrade requests are to be submitted only via gradescope.
+ In general, late submissions are not accepted (the submission server closes at the deadline). Gradescope lets you overwrite previous submissions, so it is recommended to use this feature to avoid missing the submission deadline altogether.
+ We follow the standard [UW CSE policy](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/misconduct) for academic integrity.
+ The recitation session is optional. In these sessions, Swati will review concepts from lecture, go over details (for example, of complicated calculations) that may have been unclear/too fast during lecture.
+ The office hours are for general questions about material from the lecture and homework problems.
+ Please refer to university policies regarding [disability accommodations](http://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/current-students/accommodations/) or [religious accommodations](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/).
