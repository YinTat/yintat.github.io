Yin Tat Lee is a Paul G. Allen endowed assistant professor in the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington<!--and a visiting researcher in [Microsoft Research AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/mlog/)-->. He completed his Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his undergraduate studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. His research interests are primarily in algorithms and they span a wide range of topics such as convex optimization, convex geometry, spectral graph theory, and online algorithms.

Over the past few years, he combined ideas from continuous and discrete mathematics to substantially advance the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving many fundamental problems in computer science and optimization, such as linear programming and the maximum flow problem.  As a result, he has received a variety of awards for his work, including Best Paper Award and 2 x Best Student Paper Awards at FOCS, Best Paper Award at SODA, Best Paper Award at NeurIPS, Sprowls Award, [NSF CAREER Award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1749609), [A.W. Tucker Prize](http://www.mathopt.org/?nav=tucker), [Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/faculty-fellowship/), [Sloan Research Fellowship](https://sloan.org/fellowships/), and [Packard Fellowships](https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/).

Current funding: NSF awards [CCF-1749609](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1749609), [DMS-1839116](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1839116), [DMS-2023166](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2023166), [CCF-2105772](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2105772), [Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/faculty-fellowship/), [Sloan Research Fellowship](https://sloan.org/fellowships/), [Packard Fellowships](https://www.packard.org/what-we-fund/science/packard-fellowships-for-science-and-engineering/).
